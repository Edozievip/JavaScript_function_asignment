My first Javascript function assignment on CapacityBay

The function takes in two parameters from global scope
first parameter = name. second parameter = weight in kg
use prompt to get the data from the user
convert the weight in kgs to pounds by dividing weight by 2.20462
finally return a string with the user inputed name and weight in pounds
use alert method to display the statement to the user on the browser.
